# Gene co-expression network analysis reveal core responsive genes in _Parascaris univalens_ tissues following ivermectin exposure.
Anthelmintic resistance threatens the effectiveness of critical drugs like ivermectin (IVM) against the equine parasite roundworm, _Parascaris univalens_. This study leveraged gene co-expression network analysis to elucidate tissue-specific transcriptional responses and identify core genes implicated in IVM response in _P. univalens_. Adult worms (n=28) were exposed to 10<sup>-11</sup> M and 10<sup>-9</sup> M IVM _in vitro_ for 24 hours. RNA-sequencing examined transcriptional changes in the anterior end and intestine. Differential expression analysis revealed pronounced tissue differences, with the intestine exhibiting substantially more transcriptional activity. Gene co-expression network analysis identified seven modules significantly associated with IVM response. Within these, 219 core genes were detected, largely expressed in the intestine and spanning diverse biological processes. After 10<sup>-11</sup> M IVM, intestinal core genes showed transcriptional suppression, cell cycle inhibition, and ribosomal alterations. Interestingly, genes _PgR028_g047_ (_sorb-1_), _PgB01_g200_ (_gmap-1_) and _PgR046_g017_ (_col-37_ & _col-102_) switched from downregulation at 10<sup>-11</sup> M to upregulation at 10<sup>-9</sup> M IVM. The 10<sup>-9</sup> M concentration induced cuticle and membrane integrity genes. The anterior end mostly displayed downregulation after 10<sup>-9</sup> M IVM, indicating disrupted transcriptional regulation. An interesting find was the calcium-signaling gene, _PgR047_g066_ (_gegf-1_), uniquely connected 71 genes across four modules. These genes were enriched for transmembrane signaling activity, suggesting that _PgR047_g066_ (_gegf-1_) could have a key signaling role. By unveiling tissue-specific expression patterns and highlighting biological processes through unbiased core gene detection, this study reveals intricate IVM responses in _P. univalens_. These findings can guide functional validations to further resistance mechanism understanding.
